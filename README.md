Title:  Home monitoring of epileptic patients
Status: Closed
# Students Required:  3-4 (Akshaya Pragadeeshram, Richa Rajgolikar, Divya Dadlani, Rahul Verma)  Team 320
This project deals with developing hardware and/or software parts of a headset system for monitoring of  brain states from the EEG of epileptic patients. This involves signal processing of the EEG signals to determine feature sets to be used in a machine learning environment to classify the brain states and their transitions to seizure states. These decisions will be provided to a  wireless transmission system to a "smart" phone/receiver.
